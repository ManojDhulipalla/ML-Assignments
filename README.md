## Short Description
*Machine Learning Assignment 1* is done completely using *Jupiter Notebook*. This Assignment mainly focuses on the python lists, tuples, dictionary, sets and a machine learning algorithm *K-Nearest Neighbor*. We can create lists using square brackets[], tuples using paranthesis(), dictionaries and sets using curly brackets{}. In dictionaries items are stored as key - value pairs. There are many predefined functions in Python to access and modify lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets. In this assignment we used some geometric formulas to calculate area of circle and its circumference.

To implement *K-Nearest Neighbor* on the given graph, we imported few functions from the sklearn package. sklearn package consists many Machine Learning Algorithms in it. Functions like *train_test_split()* to split data into training and testing sets and *KNeighborsClassifier()* to implement KNN on datasets. We also used some other functions like *Confusion_matrix()* to check the accuracy of the KNN algorithm.

## Short Description
*Machine Learning Assignment 2* is done completely using *Jupiter Notebook*. This Assignment focuses on the python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib. we can access arrays using *NumPy* module and we can convert these array into different dimensions i.e., converting 1-D array into 2-D array or 3-D array. we can modify those values using indexing. To analyze the data we have *pandas* library where we can load files like text, csv, excel from the system and apply different functions to modify, analyze the data and also can represent our data in visually using pandas.plot function. Using that plot function we represented our data in scatter plot. To represent out data in visual format we have *matplotlib* where we can represent data in Bar Charts, Scatter plot, pie charts and graphs. In this Assignment we represented our data in a pie chart.

## Short Description
*Machine Learning Assignment 3* is done completely using *Jupiter Notebook*. This assignment focuses on handling *supervised data classification using python sklearn library*. In this assignment, we imported few data files using read_csv method and found the correlation between two columns and visually presented the correlation between columns using seaborn python library. Naive Bayes and Support vector machine agorithms are applied on the data sets imported. Before applying these algorithms over data, first we preprocessed the dataset to remove null and noisy data present in it. After preprocessing, we applied Machoine Algorithms over the data and found the confusion matrix and accuracy. On Glass Data set, we found that Naive Bayes is performing better than the SVM based on the accuracy.

## Short Description
*Machine Learning Assignment 4* is done completely using *Jupiter Notebook*. In this assignment, we imported few CSV files using read_csv method and we trained *linear regression* model on Salary_Data data set and found mean squared error. Aditionally, represented the training and testing data in a scatter plot using Matplotlib library. Moreover, we trained *KMeans algorithm* on the K-Mean_dataset and found silhouette score of the raw data. To perform feature scaling on 
K-Mean_dataset, we used standard scaler method from sklearn library. Later, we trained KMeans on this Preprocessed datset and found silhouette score. when we compare these two silhouette scores, raw data gets better silhouette score than the preprocessed data.
